      <u>Description</u>
    </h3>

    <p>
      According to <a class="inline_asset"
                      href="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Factbook2018-ExecutiveSummary.pdf">
      Marijuana Business Daily</a> Legal sales of marijuana are expected to grow to more than $20 billion by 2022, from
      approximately $10 billion in
      2018.
    </p>
    <p>In 2017, $250 million of tax revenue was generated from the sale of marijuana, this has enabled the building of
      roads and schools in the state of Washington</p>
    <br>
    <p>But it's not all about money! </p><br>
    <p>
      In Colorado alone, there were almost 3, 000 marijuana sale licences issued to startups across the state. 900 of
      these operate as dispensaries.
      <br>But the incoming prevalence of marijuana can leave people confused and bothered. But at the heart of this fear
      is a simple lack of knowledge.<br>
      We aim to educate the confused and bridge the gap between the stoners in your backyard and confused old
      people.<br>
    </p>
    We do this by providing users with access to thousands of marijuana strains, as well as their affects. Visitors of
    our website can register, login to their account, rate strains, and eventually...view local dispensaries. All for
    free!
    <p><br>Enough reading, let's get you set up.</p>
